# AutoFish

> Works on the sound event. Therefore, for it to work, you need to turn on the sound in the game by at least 1%. You need to make the first throw with a fishing rod yourself. Then the module will do this until it breaks.

**Actions**
```java
autofish(<on|off>)
```
**Variables**
```java
AUTOFISH - Returns true if the module has loaded into the game
```
